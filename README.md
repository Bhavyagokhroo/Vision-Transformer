Vision Transformer (ViT) - PyTorch
This repository contains an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model using PyTorch. The Vision Transformer is a deep learning model for image classification tasks based on the Transformer architecture, which has shown impressive performance in various computer vision tasks.

Project Structure
This repository contains the following files:

base_model.py: This file contains the architecture of the Vision Transformer model, which is implemented using the PyTorch library. It includes the essential components such as multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, and position encoding.

pre_trained_model.py: This file contains the pre-trained version of the Vision Transformer model. It loads weights from a pre-trained model, enabling faster convergence for training on new datasets and improving model accuracy.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your_username/vision-transformer.git
cd vision-transformer
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training a Vision Transformer Model from Scratch
To train the model from scratch, simply run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python base_model.py
You may want to adjust the parameters like batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate in the script according to your requirements.

Using Pre-trained Model for Inference
If you want to use the pre-trained model for inference, you can load the weights and run predictions on new data by executing:

bash
Copy
Edit
python pre_trained_model.py
Make sure to change the input image path and other settings in the script as required.
